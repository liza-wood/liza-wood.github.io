title: "Click-through webscraping"
---
In this tutorial I will focus on scraping data from a page completely hosted on Java -- namely spatial data housed in Esri -- to learn how to click through and download data using only pointers to different web elements.

I'll do this using the USDA CropCROS (Crop Layer) data

These data are an excellent source of land use data across the US, but they do not yet have an API to interface with.

So, how can we bulk download across different conditions.


I have introduced how to host RSelenium on a remote server for headless browsing, and some of the key capabilities of it in previous tutorials. 

Three key filters:
Crops: Can select multiple

Areas: Can only select one at a time, and must be selected to export data

Years: Can only select one at a time, and default selects at 2024. You can only change the date with the slider.
