I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at University of Exeter, working on the. I am finishing my PhD at University of California Davis as a member of the Center for Environmental Policy. My degree is in Ecology and Environmental Policy with a Designated Emphasis in Computational Social Science. My research has three core areas: innovation systems and networks, innovation studies and science policy, and environmental governance. I specialize in cases related to agri-food systems, ranging from agrobiodiversity management and organic certification to nitrogen policy, but also work on other case areas (e.g. transportation). I currently hold degrees in Sustainability Science and Policy (MSc), Organic Farming (MSc), and Biology and Political Science (BA). More in my [CV](cv.html).


This website includes [workshops and tutorials](tutorials.html) in R that focus on computational and statistical topics I have learned throughout my PhD. I enjoy teaching and being involved in R user groups, and I am enthusiastic about publicly sharing code to promote data and statistical literacy, particularly for early learners.
