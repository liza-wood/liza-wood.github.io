### Science in policymaking

This research agenda is rooted in the premise that science – how it is conducted and how it is used – is not immune from politics. Instead, science and policy are in dynamic interaction, shaping one another and having a considerable impact on how we understand and react to sustainability challenges. Thus, I focus on how science is used in environmental policy using computational tools. Specifically, I work with a team designing programs and workflows for extracting and analyzing citations across a range of policy documents, allowing for large-scale bibliometric analyses.

### Innovation systems and networks 

<!---<img height="350" style="float: right; margin-left: 2em;" src="img/field.jpg"> --->

This research agenda explores the conditions under which ‘niche’ innovations develop, as these niches are an important source of the technological and organizational changes necessary for environmental sustainability. Theories in this field have been built around qualitative case studies, but rarely have these propositions been quantitatively tested. My research fills this gap by analyzing niche innovation systems using social network methods, focusing on an innovation that is deeply intertwined with regional agro-ecological diversity: agricultural seeds. Specifically, I work with the case of the organic seed niche – a network of informational, economic, and ecological relationships – built using original survey data of organic seed stakeholders in the US. In this research I have worked along with the [Organic Seed Alliance](https://seedalliance.org/) to release the [2022 State of Organic Seed Report](https://stateoforganicseed.org/state-of-organic-seed-2022/) and submit [public comments](https://seedalliance.org/2022/osa-provides-comments-to-usda-on-corporate-consolidation-and-control-over-seed/) regarding seed industry consolidation. This project is funded by the [Western Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program](https://projects.sare.org/sare_project/GW20-216/).

### Agri-environmental regulation 

In this research area, I investigate whether the policy tools designed for better environmental outcomes have their intended effect. Policies such as voluntary incentives and certification, mandatory reporting, and sponsored research support are just some of the approaches utilized by the US government. These tools often have complex designs, such as blending stringent requirements with regulator discretion, and there is still much to be understood about how and why firms comply in different policy landscapes. I use farmer surveys in different agri-environmental contexts to understand compliance from the lenses of regulation and farmer behavior literature.

### Innovation for the public good

Improving environmental outcomes will depend, in part, on technological innovation. But innovation is not value-free; it reflects the diverse motivations and imaginations of innovators. Sector can influence these motivations and public, 'mission-oriented' innovation policy has recently gained traction as a promise for sustainability transitions. However, there is still much to understand about how public institutions are involved in mission-based innovation. This research agenda shifts the focus from traditional innovation studies' attention from _how much_ to _what kinds_ of innovation are publicly supported.

### Graduate student strike action  

During Fall term of 2022, University of California graduate and post-doctoral unions went on strike to demand higher wagers, stronger protections, and more comprehensive benefits. As a fifth-year graduate student at the time of the strike action, I felt that the claims coming from both the Union and the UC were opaque. In response, I dedicated much of my strike time to digging into the data behind the union's and university's claims throughout the striking and bargaining process.  

My first initiative was [an opinion on the UC strike action vote](posts/uc_strikevote_opinion.html), which evaluated the current wages for graduate students across the US and put them in the context of cost of living the UC union's demands. I also looked into the relationship between [student and faculty salaries at the UC](posts/uc_strikepay_opinion.html), largely in response to faculty resistance at graduate student demands. Following the UC's first official communication since the start of the strike, I drafted a [response to the Provost](https://liza-wood.github.io/posts/response_to_provost_brown.html) to point out the UC's false claims regarding the wages it was offering. Finally, as the Union and the UC began making more compromising proposals, I developed an [interactive pay estimator](https://liza-wood.shinyapps.io/uc_pay_estimator/) to help graduate students understand what these proposals meant for the salaries for the following academic year.
