    "text": "Talk about Artificial Intelligence is everywhere. From university teaching, student essays, academic research, regulatory consultations, and even a whole array of unnecessary appliances like toothbrushes.\nThis post is about AI, and more specifically, Machine Learning (ML) in research. To be self-referential, claude.ai generated this overview of different ML methods and how they relate. ML covers a wide array of approaches for computer prediction based on ‘learning’ (i.e. giving the computer data). Learning is usually classified into three types: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement.\n\n\n\nOverview of machine learning concepts, generated by claude.ai\n\n\nIn each of these categories, the figure highlights that various statistical methods that have been around for quite a while fall under the ML umbrella, such as statistical regression (supervised) and Principle Component Analysis (unsupervised). But beyond these traditional approaches, each of these types of learning can use ‘neural networks’ for deep learning.\nNeural networks – computational models inspired by neural networks in biology – are typically ‘trained’ (supervised) on data so that it learns how to minimize the difference in the output and the values in the training dataset. One popular software for implementing neural networks is (Keras.io)[https://keras.io/], allowing researchers to train and develop their own predictive models.\nThe ‘transformer’ architecture behind models like ChatGPT and Claude has evolved from these sorts of neural networks (but critically, rely on a ‘self-attention mechanism’ to predict word sequence). And after being trained on massive amounts of text1, the resulting Large Language Models (LLMs) are what we can chat with in either an unsupervised fashion (open chats) or supervised fashion (LLMs that are tuned to specific tasks).\n\n\nNow that LLMs have already been trained on huge amounts of data, researchers are able to leverage the learning that has already been done to help assist with research tasks. Researchers are using LLMs in a variety of ways, ranging from synthesizing social data to generating research ideas.\nThis post is specifically about text classification (and sometimes interpretation) – reading a text and grouping the text according to a decision criteria, or extracting some feature of the text. Specifically, I will be running through how to use OpenAI models for text classification tasks."

    "section": "Getting set up",
    "text": "Getting set up\nThis post is starting from the very basics, so we are going to walk through the following, step-by-step, to get a user set up. Specifically, I am going to walk through a set-up for a scenario where you may be working with a team with a shared API key.\n\nVisit https://platform.openai.com/\n\nSign up to create an account (or log in if you already have an account via ChatGPT)\n\nNavigate to your profile\n\nOrganization &gt; Members &gt; Invite (will need to name your ‘Organization’)\n\nNavigate to Projects &gt; Create\n\nAdd members to project\n\nWithin the project, navigate to API keys &gt; Create new secret key\n\nSet up billing\n\nSteps 1-2 are fairly self explanatory, so we will start with Step 3. On the upper right-hand corner of the page, once you are logged in, you can select your name/photo icon and select ‘Your profile’ to take you to the Settings of your profile.\n Once you are in your profile, it can be useful to set up an Organization if you plan to work with collaborators. On the left-hand side of the window, under the Organizations subheading, navigate to Members.\nYou can begin by clicking on the black + Invite button on the main page to invite members to the organization. This will prompt you to name your Organization, if you have not already. After naming your organization you will be able to invite members to the organization by adding their email addresses (Step 4).\nOnce you have created your organization, Step 5 is to create a Project for you and select members to work on. As OpenAI described, “Projects are shared environments where teams can collaborate and share API resources. You can set custom rate limits and manage access to resources.” To create one, again on the left-hand side navigate to Projects (under the Organization subheading) and clicking on the black + Create button. Give your project a name.\nOnce your project is created you can add members from your organization to a specific project (Step 6). Again on the left-hand side, but now under the Project subheading, navigate to Members and click the black + Add member button. This should allow you to select members from your organization to add to the project.\nNow that the organization, membership, and projects are set up, Step 7 is about setting up your API key. This key is, as named, the passcode that permits a member of the organization to interact with the models you pay for. Under the Project subheading, navigate to API keys and click the black + Create new secret key. This will generate a key that you can only view once, so copy and store it in a protected space. Collaborators on the project should be given this key.\nAnd the final Step 8 is to add funds to the project by navigating to the Billing section under the Organization subheading. Here you can Add to credit balance the amount of money you want to spend. The balance will be run down as you use the API, according to OpenAI’s pricing model.\nAs an added element, if there are limits you would like to set on a project, such as budgets (a maximum amount that can be spent in a month) or model limits (which models are to be used in a project), you can do this under the Project’s Limits section."

    "text": "For researchers, systematically managing notes can be a game-changer for helping navigate the endless sea of knowledge the we spend our careers accumulating. There are a dozen different styles out there, which is not what I’m here to explain. Instead, this post is specific to my note-taking scenario: Free Evernote is dead, so this post is about exporting notes from Evernote into markdown files using the evernote2md package\nI have been an Evernote user for nearly a decade, particularly during my PhD (2018-2023). But as many Reddit threads will tell you, the end of 2023 marked a turning point for Evernote. Gone are the days of limitless free notes and multi-device syncing.

    "text": "In 2018, Ryan Peek created the aggiedown package: “An R Markdown template using the bookdown package for preparing a PhD thesis at the University of California Davis.” This service to the PhD students of UC Davis is incredible – it lets students link their dissertation to a lovely LaTeX format that should, ideally, make your formatting process easy and compliant with the Graduate Studies formatting guidelines. So, I wanted to continue the legacy by keeping the template alive and well (you should too, by following the guide to contributing updates as necessary during use!).\nBeyond using the template, I wanted to make my dissertation-writing life as easy as possible by integrating my mode of writing (Google Docs) with the aggiedown template. As it stands, Peek proposes either writing chapters directly into the chapter Rmd files in the package, or knitting from a “child” Rmd that lives inside a specific project. While both of these options are great, working in Google Docs until the very end let me work in edits from my committee up until the last minute, and allowed me to work with my reference manager of choice (Zotero plug-in to Google Docs) instead of dealing much with BibTeX.\nSo, I created a workflow for converting a Google Doc with Zotero-embedded references into an Rmd document that will play nicely with LaTeX templates. Though I designed this for aggiedown, it is likely tweak-able for other LaTeX templates as well. This tutorial outlines what to do, however, it assumes you have read the aggiedown README file for an understanding of how that package works first."

    "text": "Doing your thing in Google Docs\nSo, you’re writing your dissertation in a Google Doc. Great. You should use docs as you wish, with only a few things to pay attention to.\n\nUse headers appropriately. Google Docs (like Word) has text related settings where you can set Titles, Header 1, Header 2, etc. These translated well to Markdown, and so we need to make sure we use these in a consistent and compatible way with the dissertation format. Your Chapter Title should be Header 1, and then all main sections (e.g. Introduction, Methods, etc.) should be Header 2. You can continue down to subsections as much as you wish. For references, please make a Header 1 titled ‘References’ at the end of the document.\nChapter marks. To get friendly chapter marks, as advised by Ryan Peek in the aggiedown guidelines, you can embed this right into the doc (e.g. [backslash]chaptermark {organic seed policy}. Also note that because this is Chapter 1, I have a set-up chunk with the packages I need to read in images and load tables. More on chunks in the next point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode chunks. So, you’ll need to manually insert chunks, which is a trickier part. You can surely paste in your figures and tables and stuff as you write. But towards the end you’ll want to work with the model of inserting chunks into the text instead of the inserting figures and tables. For example, here I am loading in a figure, which is easy to you only need to set your chunk options and load the right path.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTables are a little trickier. All of my tables are saved as .csv files in my projects, and I have to read them in and do some manual changes to get them right. This means sometimes renaming column names and setting some kable and kableExtra options to get my table just right. Important: be sure to include a colon (;) after each line of code so that eventually the rendering will recognize a line break in the code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZotero settings. You can write the dissertation with any citation format you want via Zotero (MLA, APSA, etc.), but when you’re in the end/knitting phase, you’ll want to switchto BibTex format. See above for the directions for downloading and switching the Settings for the Style Manager. Note, in text this options is very ugly, but the heart of the conversion function is making it into something usable, so deal with it.\nReferences. I said it in 1., but it bears repeating. Insert your bibliography under a Header 1 sections called “References”. The spelling a capitalization matters here, so please be conscious of that.\nMisc formatting. This conversion will recognize simple markup like bolding and italics, will ignore things like comments in the document, but it will panic a little but over highlighting. Please don’t use highlight markup. To embed links, you can use standard markdown link embedding. For citing page numbers, I have not figured out how to put this into the workflow, so I just do not link these inline citations to Zotero."

In each chapter .Rmd built in to the aggiedown package (e.g. 01-chap1.Rmd), you’ll want to set them up so that they knit from the Rmds created in the previous step. In each chapter Rmd, you can mimic the following code chunk to draw it in. This is the only thing you need in each chapter Rmd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal touches. At the very end (i.e. you’re not going to run prep_papers.R any more) you can make any specific manual edits that you’d like by directly editing the chapter’s Rmd in the chapter project. For example, one of the main bugs that I hadn’t solved relates to footnotes. They overwrite one another because they do not get continuously numbered. If you have footnotes, you’ll need to run each chapter Rmd and make the numbers continous, otherwise you’ll have issues.\n\nOnce you’ve followed these steps, you should be able to knit from the index.Rmd file in the aggiedown package and render your thesis, stored as thesis.pdf in the book/ directory of the project.\nA few pages are below as an example. On page v., the rendering takes all of the first and second headers from the Google Doc into the table of contents. On page 5, you see the chapter title, introduction header, and then that references are embedded and linked to the bibliography, formatted based on how I specified the csl. Then on pages 16 and 19, the figure and table I showed as chunks in text are fitting in the final rendering. Note also that the page header alternatives between chapter mark on even pages (e.g. CHAPTER 1. ORGANIC SEED POLICY) and subsection headers on odd pages (e.g. 3. METHODS)."

In those models I focused on more classical cumulative ratio models, but now I am going to introduce continuation ratio models, also called a sequential model. A good review can be found in Chapters 4 and 5 of O’Connell’s Logistic Regression Models for Ordinal Response Variables. In short though, the added value is this: Unlike the more common cumulative ordered logistic regression (i.e. ordered logit), where the model is estimating the likelihood of being at or above a certain category (e.g. P(Y&gt;=2)), a sequential logit evaluates the likelihood of being in a particular level against the likelihood of being in the level just below it (e.g. P[Y&gt;2|Y&gt;=2]).\nLet’s see how we can run this models using the VGAM package.\n\nlibrary(VGAM) \n\nLoading required package: stats4\n\n\nLoading required package: splines\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\nI’ll be using the same data set described in the previous tutorial, farmer interest in adopting a new technology.\n\nhead(df)\n\n  interest acres income education econ.value envt.value info.count\n1      Not  4.84     NA        NA       4.33        3.6          1\n2 Somewhat  3.01      1         5       4.00        3.0          1\n3 Somewhat  4.17      3         2         NA         NA          1\n4     &lt;NA&gt;  4.40      3         3       5.00         NA          3\n5      Not  2.44      4         7       4.67        3.6          9\n6     Very  6.64      2         7       2.00        4.2          5\n\n\nIf we wanted to run a more classic, cumulative model, the model specifications would be as follows, namely specifying our family as “cumulative”.

The main difference is in the conditions of the linear predictors (as noted above). Deciding which family of ordered logits is right for your model may depend on model fit, or perhaps theoretically with the nature of the variable. If you believe that the stages you are evaluating are predicated on going through the previous stage, then a sequential model might be for you.\nAlso important to note in vglm() is that we cannot rely on the brant() function as we can with polr models. So, testing our proportional odds assumption (that is, the assumption that parallel = T), takes a bit of manual work. Let’s first specify the model without making the proportional odds assumption.\n\nseqntl.model.nonprop = vglm(ordered(interest) ~ acres + income + education + \n                         econ.value + envt.value + info.count, data = df, \n                          family=cratio(parallel = F))\nsummary(seqntl.model.nonprop)\n\n\nCall:\nvglm(formula = ordered(interest) ~ acres + income + education + \n    econ.value + envt.value + info.count, family = cratio(parallel = F), \n    data = df)\n\nCoefficients: \n               Estimate Std.

    "text": "Logistic regression models that regress on an ordinal dependent variable (think: Likert scale responses, course grades, categories that have a natural sequence, etc.) will use an ordered logit. Ordered logits are often run in R using polr in the MASS package, however the vglm function in the VGAM package offers a more advanced suite of options. This tutorial walks through setting up ordered logits with each function.\nFirst, let’s load in our packages.\nFor this example, suppose we are interested in the question: What drives farmers’ interest in technology x? We have data on farmers’ education and income, their farm size, as well as their attitudes towards things like earning money, protecting the environment, as well has how connected they are to different information sources. We are interested in the dependent variable: Farmer interest in the technology, scored as no interest (None), some interest (Somewhat), or very interested (Very) (1-3). Let’s inspect these data.\n\nhead(df)\n\n  interest acres income education econ.value envt.value info.count\n1      Not  4.84     NA        NA       4.33        3.6          1\n2 Somewhat  3.01      1         5       4.00        3.0          1\n3 Somewhat  4.17      3         2         NA         NA          1\n4     &lt;NA&gt;  4.40      3         3       5.00         NA          3\n5      Not  2.44      4         7       4.67        3.6          9\n6     Very  6.64      2         7       2.00        4.2          5\n\n# Make sure your dependent variable is in the right order\ndf$interest = factor(df$interest, c('Not', 'Somewhat', 'Very'))\n\nNote: These data have been inspired by farmer survey data sets, but have simulated values and therefore do not reflect any actual farmers.\n\npolr\nMost ordered logit models, such as those run with the defaults of the polr function, assume a cumulative link function. A cumulative link function looks at the probability of being at one level, compared to all of the levels below them (e.g. P(Y&gt;=2)). This is the only kind of link function available in polr, which is important to keep in mind when later comparing it to vglm.\nNow, let’s take a look at our model, where we are interested in seeing how farm operator/operation variables, attitudes, and information affect a farmer’s interest in a technology.\n\npolr.model &lt;- polr(interest ~ acres + income + education + econ.value + \n                     envt.value + info.count, data = df, Hess = T) \n# We use Hess = T in order to return the Hessian matrix, which allows us to look at the model's summary\nsummary(polr.model)\n\nCall:\npolr(formula = interest ~ acres + income + education + econ.value + \n    envt.value + info.count, data = df, Hess = T)\n\nCoefficients:\n              Value Std.

These results indicate that economic attitudes and income are significantly negatively correlated with technology interest, and environmental attitudes and information sources is positively correlated. Ordered logit coefficient values, in their raw form, is their logit value, where the strength of the effect is hard to interpret. Typically, estimates are exponentiated to be read as odds.\n\npolr.model$coefficients\n\n      acres      income   education  econ.value  envt.value  info.count \n 0.06972332 -0.18701627 -0.02323590 -0.50213351  0.57937593  0.14728163 \n\n\nWe can also calculate the p-value manually for an easier read of results, and bind it to the summary table.\n\n# Save an object as the coefficient table\nctable &lt;- coef(summary(polr.model))\n# Calculate and store p values\np &lt;- round((pnorm(abs(ctable[, \"t value\"]), lower.tail = FALSE) * 2),3)\n# Bind these objects into one table\ntable &lt;- cbind(ctable, \"p value\" = p)\n\ntable\n\n                    Value Std.

What is assumed here is that the slopes from level to level of the dependent variable are relatively similar, allowing us to use only one coefficient per independent variable. The Brant test was developed to test this assumption, and the brant package and function allow us to quickly test this with polr model objects.\n\nbrant(polr.model)\n\n-------------------------------------------- \nTest for    X2  df  probability \n-------------------------------------------- \nOmnibus     33.3    6   0\nacres       0.43    1   0.51\nincome      0.35    1   0.55\neducation   1.47    1   0.22\necon.value  19.17   1   0\nenvt.value  1   1   0.32\ninfo.count  1.46    1   0.23\n-------------------------------------------- \n\nH0: Parallel Regression Assumption holds\n\n\nThis test evaluates whether or not the proportional odds assumption has been met, where the null hypothesis is that the assumption has been met. In this case, a p-value &lt; 0.05 is cause to reject the null hypothesis, meaning that reject the proportional odds assumption. Based on these outputs, we see that the overall (Omnibus) model fails the proportional odds test, where probability = 0, and this is particularly driven by economic values, where the p-value is \\(1.2^{-5}\\).\nA failed proportional odds assumption calls for a non-proportional ordered logit, or at least partial proportional model. However, polr doesn’t allow us to do this, which is where we switch to vglm.\n\n\nvglm\nThe vglm function can model more advanced ordinal regressions – non-proportional and partial proportional, as well as different link functions. However, it requires a few more model specifications than the polr model. We will explore these using the same data as above.\nFirst, you need to specify the family of the link function. As noted above, the default family for polr and most people thinking about ordered logits is the cumulative link function, so for now we will leave it at that with family = cumulative. (See my post on the sequential ordered logit using the cratio link function). We also get to specify whether or not the parallel odds assumption, also called the proportional odds assumption, has been met with parallel = T/F. Last, the default in vglm is to reverse the order of the ordered dependent variable, so most intuitive interpretations require that the order be reversed with reverse = T. Below are examples of running the proportional, non-proportional, and partial proportional models. Note that the partial proportional model is specified by using a ~ followed by the variable(s) that you want to be left not proportional.\n\n# a proportional model\nvgam.model.prop &lt;- vglm(ordered(interest) ~ acres + income + education + \n                         econ.value + envt.value + info.count, data = df, \n                       family=cumulative(parallel = T, reverse = T))\n\n# a non-proportional model\nvgam.model.nonprop &lt;- vglm(ordered(interest) ~ acres + income + education + \n                            econ.value + envt.value + info.count,  data = df, \n                          family=cumulative(parallel = F, reverse = T))\n\n# a partial proportional model\nvgam.model.partialprop &lt;- vglm(ordered(interest) ~ acres + income + education + \n                                econ.value + envt.value + info.count, data = df, \n                              family=cumulative(parallel = F ~ econ.value, reverse = T))\n\nWhile polr model objects of the S3 class, as are most objects in R, vglm models are S4. In this case, while some functions operate the same, others vary. For instance, you can use the same summary() function.\n\n# vagm models provide p-values immediately\nsummary(vgam.model.partialprop)\n\n\nCall:\nvglm(formula = ordered(interest) ~ acres + income + education + \n    econ.value + envt.value + info.count, family = cumulative(parallel = F ~ \n    econ.value, reverse = T), data = df)\n\nCoefficients: \n              Estimate Std.

    "text": "Simulate networks, ERGM\nNow that we understand simulate_baseline, we can use a more complex baseline model. Rather than use a random graph, which most graphs are likely to be significantly different from, we can simulate networks using Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs).\nFor SENs, however, we need to think about what kind of ERGM makes sense as baseline. Sometimes, ecological networks are ‘fixed’, meaning that ecological relationships are not a matter of choice. In an example, the interdependence between hydrological areas are fairly fixed (barring engineering) because water flows are dependent on the geomorphology of a place. In these scenarios, we can estimate a ‘partial’ ERGM, using only the social level, given that this is the only level really able to change.\nTo do this, we make a subgraph of our SEN to include just the social actors, and specify an ERGM.\n\n## So we can create a subgraph of just the social level\nactor_net &lt;- motifr::induced_level_subgraph(SEN_net, \n                                            level = 1, \n                                            lvl_attr = \"sesType\")\n### And then specify an ergm for the actors\nactor_ergm &lt;- ergm(actor_net ~ density + \n                     nodematch(\"type\", diff=TRUE) +\n                     nodefactor(\"type\") + \n                     gwdegree(.5, fixed = TRUE) +\n                     gwesp(.25, fixed=TRUE))\n\nThen we use this partial ERGM as the baseline model for our simulations.\n\n## Now, instead of model = erdos renyi, model = 'partial-ergm', \n## specify what level the ergm is partial for, and the ergm itself\nsim_ergm_p &lt;- simulate_baseline(SEN_net,\n                                motifs_of_interest, \n                                n = n_iter, \n                                lvl_attr = \"sesType\",\n                                model = \"partial_ergm\",\n                                level = 1,\n                                ergm_model = actor_ergm\n                                )\n\nIn a case where ecological nodes are not fixed (e.g. foraging behavior), we can also run and set a full ERGM as your baseline.\n\nse_ergm &lt;- ergm(SEN_net ~ edges + \n                          nodefactor(\"sesType\") +\n                          gwdegree(.5, fixed = TRUE) +\n                          gwesp(.25, fixed=TRUE))\n\n\nsim_ergm &lt;- simulate_baseline(SEN_net,\n                                motifs_of_interest, \n                                n = n_iter, \n                                lvl_attr = \"sesType\",\n                                model = \"ergm\",\n                                ergm_model = se_ergm\n                                )"
