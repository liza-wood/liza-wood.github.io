    "text": "Seed innovation systems\n\nSeed systems – the seed savers, breeders, producers, companies, and agencies that are responsible for supplying our agricultural system with seeds – are complex networks that rely on coordination of information and resources across multiple stakeholders. Little is known about the systems-level interactions that support such a system, and the organic sector faces particular challenges with regards to research & development, intellectual property protections, and supply chain reliability. For this work, along with the Organic Seed Alliance, I conduct network analyses of organic seed systems to better understand opportunities for supporting transitions to a more sustainable seed system. We have released the 2022 State of Organic Seed Report, alongside an interactive data site to explore the survey and network data. We have also worked together to submit public comments regarding seed industry consolidation. This project is funded by the Western Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program.\nRelevant publications and reports:\n\nWood, L. (2023).

Instead, policy-makers often use science that speaks to their problem framing, and scientists ask and frame questions based on their positionality. To understand how policy-makers use science, I am working with a team to design computational tools for extracting and analyzing citations across a range of policy documents. My main case is the transportation sector, where agencies rely on a vast array of science and engineering inputs to design infrastructure, site and plan operations, and make policies. To understand how and where transportation and transit agencies use science, this project looks at scientific resources that state and regional transit agencies use for plans and projects. Transportation planning and project development processes generate large quantities of procedural documents – plans, project proposals, and environmental assessments, which we analyze to extract and assess the nature and sources of science that informs transportation governance.\nRelevant publications and projects:\n\nWood, L & Scott, T.A.

Policies such as voluntary incentives and certification, mandatory reporting, and sponsored research support are just some of the approaches utilized by the US government. My work in this area looks at programs like the Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program (ILRP), a California policy that mandates engagement with information-based tools. In the context of the ILRP, we evaluate farmers surveys to quantitatively assess the stages that farmers go through as they learn about nitrogen management and change behavior. A summary of our team’s research research can be found in this PDF presentation. We have also evaluated farmers’ opinions related to policies for California’s Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA).\nRelevant publications and projects:\n\nWood, L., Lubell, M., Rudnick, J., Khalsa, S.D.S., Tatge, S., Sears, M., Brown, P.

As a fifth-year graduate student at the time of the strike action, I felt that the claims coming from both the Union and the UC were opaque. In response, I dedicated much of my strike time to digging into the data behind the union’s and university’s claims throughout the striking and bargaining process.\nMy first initiative was an opinion on the UC strike action vote, which evaluated the current wages for graduate students across the US and put them in the context of cost of living the UC union’s demands. I also looked into the relationship between student and faculty salaries at the UC, largely in response to faculty resistance at graduate student demands. Following the UC’s first official communication since the start of the strike, I drafted a response to the Provost to point out the UC’s false claims regarding the wages it was offering. Finally, as the Union and the UC began making more compromising proposals, I developed an interactive pay estimator to help graduate students understand what these proposals meant for the salaries for the following academic year."

    "text": "UC graduate students have been striking for three days now, and graduate students and faculty alike still have questions about the Union’s demands. Particularly, there are a number of running comments I hear that challenge the strikers demands. I’d like to create some posts responding to these throughout the strike weeks.\nOne of the comments I’ve heard is: Graduate students are asking to be paid more than some faculty. And well, are they? Having a base understanding of faculty pay is critical to understanding that question. The good news is that public salaries over a certain threshold are publicly released, and so we can easily contextualize graduate student pay demands alongside faculty pay.\nAn initial look at the University of California Faculty Pay Ladder might suggest that yes, asking for $54,000 for 50% FTE ($108,000 100% FTE) is more than what these faculty steps outline. But I think it is important to look a bit deeper, both at faculty pay and at the demands of the union. This blog will do just that to make two key points:\n1. UCOP Faculty pay ladder alone is misleading\n2. Graduate students have so much to gain from bargaining for even a fraction of the union’s current demands"

    "text": "How much do UC faculty make?\nThe University of California Faculty Pay Ladder for General faculty and a higher tier of faculty from Business, Economics, and Engineering have been used by faculty to signal to students: Look, faculty don’t make all that much more than graduate students, especially not compared to their $54,000 demand. But publicly available data about faculty salaries suggest otherwise.\nI have scraped publicly available salaries through the Transparent California database for faculty in the University of California system. I’ve focused on Assistant, Associate, and Full faculty, both AY and FY, within typical university departments (i.e. I have removed Medical and Law school faculty) in 2021. The total number of faculty represented is 7867. (Note that there are some faculty excluded from these data given rate limits on the Transparent California page, but I have done my best to ensure that the variation is random. See the uc-faculty-pay script for details on the data scraping).\nWhen comparing the UC pay ladder to both “regular pay”, as termed in the Transparent California database, as well as “other pay,” (off-scale), it is clear that the hiring process looks quite different in practice than on paper. Below I visualize the ranges of pay according to the UCOP scale, regular pay, and regular + other pay. Note that I have limited the y-axis so to more clearly see the difference in median values across the categories, but this hides the upper end salaries of Full professors, which at a maximum is $778,102.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also take a look at a table of the average salaries across these categories, below.\n\n\n\n\nAverage pay according to faculty rank across all UC faculty\n \n  \n    Rank \n    UCOP scale \n    Regular pay \n    Total pay \n  \n \n\n  \n    Assistant \n    $ 88,110 \n    $ 112,762 \n    $ 138,316 \n  \n  \n    Associate \n    $ 104,444 \n    $ 128,664 \n    $ 152,256 \n  \n  \n    Full \n    $ 145,317 \n    $ 204,647 \n    $ 244,142 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we take a look at these numbers, it seems like the UCOP pay scale is only representing somewhere between 60-65% of what faculty are actually making across the UC.\n\n\n\nNow, these are data all across the UC, spanning wide reaches of departments, expertise, etc., so we might say that these numbers are a bit exaggerated. To be sure this check wasn’t missing some faculty grouping that over-inflated the numbers, I spot checked the data by scraping only the faculty in my department: Environmental Science and Policy at UC Davis, in 2021. Among these 20 faculty, average salaries across ranks tend to be about $20,000 less than across the whole UC system, but this is likely because Davis offers different salaries than the rest of the state, and ESP is not among the highest ranking salary ladders (for instance, the Business, Economics, and Engineering departments are simply hired at higher rates, even on paper). So it seems like these UC numbers, both state-wide and hyper-locally, can give us a decent picture of UC faculty salary ranges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage pay for UCD ESP faculty\n \n  \n    Rank \n    UCOP scale \n    Regular pay \n    Total pay \n  \n \n\n  \n    Assistant \n    $ 88,110 \n    $ 99,525 \n    $ 109,572 \n  \n  \n    Associate \n    $ 104,444 \n    $ 126,977 \n    $ 152,874 \n  \n  \n    Full \n    $ 145,317 \n    $ 201,382 \n    $ 220,094 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s think about these numbers. Even in a world where the union gets its demands of $54,000 for 50% FTE, this will still never realistically be higher than faculty. Even if a graduate student were working at their absolute maximum, 75% during the academic year and 100% during the summer at the demanded rate, they would make $87,750. For context, the lowest total salary in the Environmental Science and Policy Department is $96,619. But also importantly, there is absolutely no world in which the union gets their maximum ask. So let’s consider what graduate students realistically stand to gain during this bargaining process."

    "text": "What kinds of salary might graduate students realistically gain from the strike?\nI’ll admit, I myself have balked at the $54,000 demand by the union. I’ve already addressed this elsewhere, so I’ll point to a piece I wrote the other week regarding the reality of graduate student pay, and how the bargaining process might actually land us somewhere competitive. In summary, I know $54,000 is not realistic. But a realistic ask (between $36,837 and $42,573, depending on whether or not we adjust for different costs of living across campus) would make a huge difference for graduate students, and keep graduate student pay competitive with its peers. This pay raise, from $29,621 to $36,837, about a 30% raise, also puts UC graduate students in similar relative positions to faculty in their departments.\nTo understand graduate student pay relative to faculty pay, let’s look at the average pay across faculty ranks for Environmental Science and Policy Department at UC Davis (regular pay, not including additional ‘other’ pay), compared to pay from another large public university’s environmental science department: University of Michigan’s School for Environment and Sustainability. Pays are relatively similar for faculty between the two schools, with slightly higher rates at UCD. But when we overlay graduate student data here, we see that graduate students at Michigan make nearly $7,000 more annually than UCD graduate students at 50% FTE. What this means is that graduate students at UCD make relatively less money than peers in Michigan, not just in absolute terms but also relative to the faculty. For example relative to Associate Professors, graduate students in Michigan make 31% of their salary while those in California make 23% of their salary.\nA realistic bargain, then, as outlined in my previous post, is 90% of living wage in the area. This would boost UCD graduate students’ salaries up on par with Michigan and still only less than a third of what faculty make, at 50% FTE (see table below). And even if students work at their maximum (75% FTE all academic year and 100% FTE all summer), they would earn $59,860 – still only 60% of the mean Assistant Professor salary, before ‘other pay’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage faculty pay and its relationship to graduate student pay\n \n  \n    Rank \n    University of Michigan \n    University of California (current) \n    University of California (realistic bargain) \n  \n \n\n  \n    Graduate Student \n    $ 36,082 \n    $ 29,621 \n    $ 36,837 \n  \n  \n    Assistant \n    103453 (35%) \n    99525 (30%) \n    99525 (37%) \n  \n  \n    Associate \n    118012 (31%) \n    126977 (23%) \n    126977 (29%) \n  \n  \n    Full \n    187309 (19%) \n    201382 (15%) \n    201382 (18%)"

    "text": "UC students are voting on whether they want to strike this week. The strike is driven by many years running of incremental bargaining for improved cost of living and rights for all types of student-related UC employment, from junior specialists and GSRs, to TAs and post-docs. The main point of the strike that interests me is the proposed cost of living adjustments. I can attest to the general sentiment that graduate students feel over-worked, underpaid, and constantly battling administrative and bureaucratic hurdles to ensure their employment every 12 weeks. But at the same time, the UC bargaining team has proposed a pretty radical number for fair wages for all ‘Grad Workers’ (unspecified in who exactly they mean here): $54,000 as a minimum salary, assuming that graduate students are working 50% year-round.\nThe Union’s proposal of $54,000 for 50% full-time equivalent (FTE) sounds radically high, and it is. My gut response to this number was rejection – it felt unjustifiable. But before denying it outright, I wanted to understand more about how high this really is relative to current UCD student salaries, and how this compares to other graduate student salaries across the country. This short opinion pieces summarizes what I’ve learned.\nNote: This consideration of pay considers ‘Grad Workers’ as Teaching Assistants and Graduate Student Researchers. While Fellows are a part of the newly formed SRU and are currently bargaining alongside the GSRs and TAs, I have already seen language in the UC’s proposals to define Grad Workers as those ‘paid through UC Path’, which I think excludes Fellows."

    "text": "How much money do UC graduate students make?\nFirst things first: What is the pay baseline we’re starting from? The UAW website says that the ‘most common’ salary for graduate students is $23,247, citing UCDP. I assume this is UC Data Portal, but it is not clear how to access this, when the data is from, and how that was calculated. So instead I took data from the UCD Grad Studies Pay Scale document that comes out annually (this one is old because, well, still bargaining). Here we have a flat TA rate of $46,493, which is a 9-month rate at 100%, calculating out to $2,582.95 each month TAing at 50%. There are also GSR rates, which has default steps for a compensation plan, whereby Step III is (usually) the initial appointment. I will consider this the GSR minimum, based on my understanding of the system, though this decision may make graduate student minimum pay appear slightly higher. The Step III GSR rate is $52,604 at a 12-month rate, calculating out to $2,191.84 each month GSRing at 50%. My general understanding is that these pay rates are standardized across the UC campuses. A quick look at the pay scales for UC Santa Barbara and UCLA seem to confirm this.\nUsing these data, I define the minumum graduate student income to be some mix of these two employment methods, where a student’s annual salary working year-round at 50% with a 50/50 mix of these appointments is $28,648.62. This is a pretty big departure from UAW’s estimate, especially considering this is my minimum compared to what sounds like their idea of average (my calculated average is $29,621). That aside, we’ll proceed with my estimated minimum because it followed a standardized approach (50% mixed appointments), which I use for understanding other university pay rates.\n\n\n\n\nA generous calculation of a graduate student’s salary working 50% FTE year-round is, at minimum, $28,648.62, and as an average, $29,621"

What is a competitive asking price? One way to answer this question is compare UC salaries to other graduate pay rates across the country.\nI selected a handful of other universities that feel comparable to where I am housed (UC Davis), and that have some overlap with my work in environmental policy. They feel comparable in that they are large public universities from various locations across the country, capturing a range of living costs. And as a member of the Environmental Science and Policy Department, I wanted to know how graduate students are paid in schools that have comparable Environmental Science/Environmental Policy programs. I settled on the following universities, with their details below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    University \n    Undergrad # \n    Postgrad # \n  \n \n\n  \n    University of California, Davis \n    31,162 \n    8,869 \n  \n  \n    University of Washington \n    32,779 \n    16,246 \n  \n  \n    University of Florida \n    37,874 \n    15,916 \n  \n  \n    University of Michigan, Ann Arbor \n    31,329 \n    16,578 \n  \n  \n    University of Georgia \n    40,118 \n    9,952 \n  \n  \n    Indiana University, Bloomington \n    34,253 \n    11,075 \n  \n  \n    Arizona State University \n    38,528 \n    10,943 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nI grabbed the pay rates for graduate students from each of these schools. The details of where I found and collated these data can be found annotated in my grad-pay-rate script. From my look across these documents, other universities tend to set a clear minimum for graduate pay, but less detail on the various employment categories. Because this is the case, I’ll stick with using the minimum pay for these graduate programs when comparing pay scales.\nLet’s first see how UC grad student pay measures up in absolute terms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, in absolute terms, UC is somewhere in the middle of the pack according to minimum pay rates. But these are in absolute terms. How does this pay relate to the financial demands of the location? This is what I explore next."

UAW seems to be relying on union member surveys to gather data on how much rent costs are for graduate students, which they use as the basis to discuss rent burden. I’m not entirely convinced by their approach here, but luckily, there are tools that can provide some rich data on cost-of living. I rely on the MIT’s Living Wage Calculator, which I think provides a well-documented understanding of living wages (thank you Tara Pozzi, for suggesting this resource).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    University \n    City \n    MIT Living Wage \n  \n \n\n  \n    University of Michigan, Ann Arbor \n    Ann Arbor, MI \n    $ 38,537 \n  \n  \n    Arizona State University \n    Tempe, AZ \n    $ 36,504 \n  \n  \n    Indiana University, Bloomington \n    Bloomington, IN \n    $ 33,065 \n  \n  \n    University of Florida \n    Gainseville, FL \n    $ 31,748 \n  \n  \n    University of Washington \n    Seattle, WA \n    $ 41,198 \n  \n  \n    University of California, Davis \n    Davis, CA \n    $ 40,930 \n  \n  \n    University of Georgia \n    Athens, GA \n    $ 33,042 \n  \n  \n    University of California, Santa Barbara \n    Santa Barbara, CA \n    $ 50,497 \n  \n  \n    University of California, Los Angeles \n    Los Angeles, CA \n    $ 44,961 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nNote that these calculated estimates should be taken with a grain of salt. For example, MIT estimates that housing costs under ‘living wages’ are $1,174/month in Davis, while UAW estimates somewhere between $1,131-$1,643. MIT’s estimate is based on Yolo County, and for areas like Los Angeles, the estimate is based on the whole of the metropolitan area. So of course, it should be recognized that areas close to universities campuses are perhaps more expensive than the ‘greater area’ represented by these MIT calculator numbers.\nWith that caveat, let’s take a look at what the minimum graduate student pay is, as a proportion of the area’s living wage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce adjusting for the cost of living, UC compares poorly to its peers. The average proportion of the living wage covered by 50% employment (at the minimum rate) by the six other schools in these data is .82. UC Davis, one of the cheapest UC campuses, is 12% lower than the mean proportion of these living schools, coming in at .7 of the area’s living wage. Pricier UC campuses fare even worse, with graduate students at UCLA making .64 and UCSB making .57 of the living wage. From this preliminary look, it is pretty clear:\n\n\n\n\nUC pay for graduate students lags behind comparable programs across the country and needs to take considerable action to step up."

For the Davis, LA, and Santa Barbara campuses respectively, this would still leave grad students at .75, .68, and .61 of the living wage. This still leaves UC campuses far below average compared to its peers.\n\n\n\nInstead, UAW’s proposal sets an ambitious new minimum of $54,000 at 50% FTE.

Based on data from comparable universities, it seems like 90% of a city’s living wage is a competitive ask. Because the UC wants to set UC-wide pay grades, let’s take a look at the living wages across 9 UC campuses (SF excluded):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    UC Campus \n    Living wage \n  \n \n\n  \n    Berkeley \n    $ 53,149 \n  \n  \n    Santa Barbara \n    $ 52,675 \n  \n  \n    Los Angeles \n    $ 45,536 \n  \n  \n    San Diego \n    $ 47,304 \n  \n  \n    Riverside \n    $ 38,821 \n  \n  \n    Merced \n    $ 34,219 \n  \n  \n    Irvine \n    $ 51,843 \n  \n  \n    Santa Cruz \n    $ 54,571 \n  \n  \n    Davis \n    $ 40,930 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe values from across MIT’s Living Wage Calculator estimates that the median cost of living across the 9 campuses is $47,304, and 90% of that is $42,573. Let’s take a look at how this proposal adjusts UC’s place among its peers for graduate student pay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this more reasonable, UC-wide proposal, UC Davis is very comfortably at the top, making right around a living wage for the area. But campuses like Santa Barbara (and also even more expensive campuses like Berkeley and Santa Cruz), are still very average in terms of pay as a proportion of a living wage. Personally, I think the differences between cost of living are so considerable that it would be fair to be negotiating for 90% of living wage adjusting for the campus. If this were there case, Davis’s campus would still be competitive by offering a minimum wage of $36,837."

    "text": "Re-analysis in the context of barganing\nHere’s my take: UC proposes as 7% raise, UAW is asking for an 88% raise, and my data is pointing to a more realistic/competitive ask of 45% raise. And well, if bargaining works where folks end up meeting in the middle, then we’d land right about at the 40% raise mark, which feels like a competitive win. So my impression is that the strike should not be about getting to $54,000, but rather, starting high in response to UC starting very, very low, and using that to land on a reasonable middle ground where the UC system can be competitive among its peers. I encourage folks not balk at $54,000, rather to think critically about how this demand can help us enter the bargaining room with plenty of room for compromise and discussion about fair wages.\n\n\n\ntl;dr I will strike to increase bargaining power in the hopes that we can agree to a reasonable middle-ground, making the UC a system with competitive university pay. If we agree to a fixed value across the UC, students other UC campuses would benefit very meaningfully and Davis students would outmatch its competitors."

    "text": "On November 15, Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs, Dr. Michael Brown, sent a letter to UC administration and faculty to provide an update on their offers re: UC UAW strike (see the letter here). It is frustrating to see summaries like this that omit nuance and supporting data (note, I have similar gripes about UAW’s communication), so I’d like to comment on a couple of unsubstantiated and misleading claims made by the University of California."

    "title": "In response to Provost Brown",
    "section": "Claim 1: Competitive compensation",
    "text": "Claim 1: Competitive compensation\nProvost Brown’s letter states: “Under our current proposals, our academic student employees would be among the highest compensated among public universities in the Association of American Universities (AAU), with compensation similar to what top private institutions offer.”\nThere was a similar quote in an article in the SF Chronicle: “In its statement, the university defended its offers to the union, saying that if accepted, the wages would be among the best paid in public universities and ‘more comparable to private universities such as Harvard, MIT, and USC.’”.\nThese comparisons claiming competitive compensation are unsubstantiated. In a comparison to other public universities around the country, University of California lags behind, and the proposed increases of 7-10% would still leave us at the tail end. I’ve already explored UC pay relative to other schools in another post, but here is a quick visualization of where UC would fall, relative to cost of living, compared to other public universities under the UC’s proposal. A 7% raise brings grad students on UC campuses up from the current 57-70% of their area’s living wage to 61-75% of living wage. This pales in comparison to its public university peers, who pay an average of 82% living wage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, claiming that this puts UC on par with ‘top private institutions’ has no basis. A UC graduate student employed at 50% at a Step III appointment (which is considered the default minimum hiring rate, according to UCD salary scales, see the next point for further discussion), is $2,191. A 10% increase (again, being generous, see the next section) would be $2,410.\nIn contrast, Harvard’s compensation plan, which is the base rate for all students regardless of employment is $3,549 per month. Stanford’s compensation plan for 50% FTE is a minimum of $3,816 per month. The UC’s proposal positions its graduates students to making less than 70% of the top private institutions the administration claims to match."

    "title": "In response to Provost Brown",
    "section": "Claim 2: 9-10% increase for GSRs",
    "text": "Claim 2: 9-10% increase for GSRs\nProvost Brown’s letter states: “Most GSRs will see 9-10 percent increases in year one of the contract, with a 3 percent increase in each subsequent year. GSRs who are on the lowest two salary points will see a 17-26 percent increase in the first year. For example, a GSR who is currently on Step 2 with a 50% appointment will see their monthly salary increase by 17.5 percent in the first year of the contract.”\nThis claim is misleading for those unfamiliar with how hiring across steps works in practice. The focus of this claim is put on the 17-26% raise for Step I and II GSRs, but there’s an issue here. At least according to the UC Davis’s account of the Graduate Student Salary Scale, the default compensation plan is such that Step III is the “initial appointment of student with a bachelor’s degree only.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to this default plan then, Step I and Step II shouldn’t be used. I cannot speak to how many students are actually hired at these steps, but personally and among my peers, the initial hiring is Step III. Step III is also what I have considered the ‘minimum’ in my analyses so far. What this means is that the UC’s most impressive-looking talking point is moot. They’re proposing wage increases for steps on a salary scale that, by the own proposed default, shouldn’t be used.\nAs a result, it calls into question the more general claim of a 9-10% increase for GSRs. If the increases are 17% and 26% for Steps I and II, these values could be over inflating the increase gained by other steps. UC is not explicit about this. On their webpage they state that: Current rates are $22,005 — $43,119 and proposed rates are $28,275 — $47,679. SO we can then assume that highest step, Step X, increases by 11%. But again, the UC default scale suggests that student post-QE should be hired at Steps VI-VII, meaning that Steps IX and X are very atypical. From my personal experience, as a fifth year student with well-developed data analysis skills, I have negotiated for only one Step IX appointment under the employment of a very supportive faculty member. So if 17%, 26% and 11% are the increases for steps that are generally not relevant to graduate students, the remaining increases in Steps III-IX must be lower to generate a 9-10% average increase. Most likely then, the raises for the most relevant steps are only about 5%. I would appreciate seeing a step by step breakdown of the raise increases to better understand what’s being offered to the most relevant salary steps."

This was a workshop designed for the UC Davis Mexican Graduate Student Association.\n\nTreating text as data with PDFs and regex\nHighlighting key avenues for working with text as data (web scraping, PDF reading, and OCR) and digging into common uses for regular expressions (regex) for cleaning messy text data with an emphasis on the stringr package. This was a presentation designed for for the Davis R-Users Group mini-workshops.\n\nIntroduction to the Tidyverse\nIntroductory guidance through essential data cleaning and visualizing pipelines using the tidy workflow. This was a workshop designed for the UC Davis Mexican Graduate Student Association.\n\nNetwork visualization with ggraph\nAn intermediate exploration of network data, including a brief review of storing and managing network data and objects, and a focus on integrating network summaries with visualization according to the grammar of graphics. This workshop was designed for the UC Davis DataLab’s micro-credential program.\n\nWebscraping public records with rvest + regex intro\nA re-vamp of my first webscraping, I demonstrate how to scrape data from public salary database, https://transparentcalifornia.com/. This was a presentation designed for for the Davis R-Users Group mini-workshops.\n\nIntroduction to creating a package with roxygen2\nBuilding off of the function-writing tutorial, I walk through the steps it takes to turn a function into a package using the roxygen2 package. This was a presentation designed for for the Davis R-Users Group mini-workshops.\n\nReal-world function writing\nMost function tutorials walk through achieving some basic arithmetic function when instructing the use of function-writing. This approach uses the case of reading in US Patent Office .csv files and cleaning up the data to demonstrate the usefulness of combining functions and iteration. This was a presentation designed for for the Davis R-Users Group mini-workshops.\n\nSelecting ERGM decay values\nWalking through the challenge of decay value selection for running an ergm on networks with right-skewed degree distributions, and options for improving fit.\n\nWebscraping with xml2 + rvest\nReviewing some of the basic functions within xml2 and rvest for database scraping, using an example of the National Germplasm Repository database.\n\nNetwork introduction with network + igraph\nDigging into the differences in syntax of network packages for descriptives and plotting. This is mainly a comparison of network objects and igraph objects, and the slightly different approaches to working with these data. Example from a Twitter retweet network.\n\nOrdered logits introduction with MASS + VGAM\nA brief introduction to ordered logits using two different packages in R, reviewing the different model specifications and some of the more advances features of the VGAM package, particularly non-proportional and partial proportional models. Example using simulated farmer survey data.\n\nSequential ordered logits\nAdvancing on the ordered logit introduction, this provides an overview of the continuation ratio (also called sequential) model to ordered logits that want to analyze a dependent ordinal variable that constitutes sequential stages. Example using simulated farmer survey data.\n\nIntroduction to R programming videos\nThese videos, recorded with co-instructors Christian John, Tyler Scott, and Tara Pozzi, are available from each year of R-DAVIS instruction."
