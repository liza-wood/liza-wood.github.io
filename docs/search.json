    "section": "",
    "text": "In a previous tutorial I went over two packages for ordered logits – polr() and vglm() – and walked through some of the basics for running models in both. In those models I focused on more classical cumulative ratio models, but now I am going to introduce continuation ratio models, also called a sequential model. A good review can be found in Chapters 4 and 5 of O’Connell’s Logistic Regression Models for Ordinal Response Variables. In short though, the added value is this: Unlike the more common cumulative ordered logistic regression (i.e. ordered logit), where the model is estimating the likelihood of being at or above a certain category (e.g. P(Y&gt;=2)), a sequential logit evaluates the likelihood of being in a particular level against the likelihood of being in the level just below it (e.g. P[Y&gt;2|Y&gt;=2]).\nLet’s see how we can run this models using the VGAM package.\n\nlibrary(VGAM) \n\nLoading required package: stats4\n\n\nLoading required package: splines\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\nI’ll be using the same data set described in the previous tutorial, farmer interest in adopting a new technology.\n\nhead(df)\n\n  interest acres income education econ.value envt.value info.count\n1      Not  4.84     NA        NA       4.33        3.6          1\n2 Somewhat  3.01      1         5       4.00        3.0          1\n3 Somewhat  4.17      3         2         NA         NA          1\n4     &lt;NA&gt;  4.40      3         3       5.00         NA          3\n5      Not  2.44      4         7       4.67        3.6          9\n6     Very  6.64      2         7       2.00        4.2          5\n\n\nIf we wanted to run a more classic, cumulative model, the model specifications would be as follows, namely specifying our family as “cumulative”. Note we are also specifying that parallel = T for now, indicating that we assume that the slopes between stages are parallel, and that we reverse the order of our stages because vglm() oddly defaults to descending order.\n\ncumltv.model &lt;- vglm(ordered(interest) ~ acres + income + education + \n                         econ.value + envt.value + info.count, data = df, \n                       family=cumulative(parallel = T, reverse = T))\nsummary(cumltv.model)\n\n\nCall:\nvglm(formula = ordered(interest) ~ acres + income + education + \n    econ.value + envt.value + info.count, family = cumulative(parallel = T, \n    reverse = T), data = df)\n\nCoefficients: \n              Estimate Std.

The main difference is in the conditions of the linear predictors (as noted above). Deciding which family of ordered logits is right for your model may depend on model fit, or perhaps theoretically with the nature of the variable. If you believe that the stages you are evaluating are predicated on going through the previous stage, then a sequential model might be for you.\nAlso important to note in vglm() is that we cannot rely on the brant() function as we can with polr models. So, testing our proportional odds assumption (that is, the assumption that parallel = T), takes a bit of manual work. Let’s first specify the model without making the proportional odds assumption.\n\nseqntl.model.nonprop = vglm(ordered(interest) ~ acres + income + education + \n                         econ.value + envt.value + info.count, data = df, \n                          family=cratio(parallel = F))\nsummary(seqntl.model.nonprop)\n\n\nCall:\nvglm(formula = ordered(interest) ~ acres + income + education + \n    econ.value + envt.value + info.count, family = cratio(parallel = F), \n    data = df)\n\nCoefficients: \n               Estimate Std.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Logistic regression models that regress on an ordinal dependent variable (think: Likert scale responses, course grades, categories that have a natural sequence, etc.) will use an ordered logit. Ordered logits are often run in R using polr in the MASS package, however the vglm function in the VGAM package offers a more advanced suite of options. This tutorial walks through setting up ordered logits with each function.\nFirst, let’s load in our packages.\nFor this example, suppose we are interested in the question: What drives farmers’ interest in technology x? We have data on farmers’ education and income, their farm size, as well as their attitudes towards things like earning money, protecting the environment, as well has how connected they are to different information sources. We are interested in the dependent variable: Farmer interest in the technology, scored as no interest (None), some interest (Somewhat), or very interested (Very) (1-3). Let’s inspect these data.\n\nhead(df)\n\n  interest acres income education econ.value envt.value info.count\n1      Not  4.84     NA        NA       4.33        3.6          1\n2 Somewhat  3.01      1         5       4.00        3.0          1\n3 Somewhat  4.17      3         2         NA         NA          1\n4     &lt;NA&gt;  4.40      3         3       5.00         NA          3\n5      Not  2.44      4         7       4.67        3.6          9\n6     Very  6.64      2         7       2.00        4.2          5\n\n# Make sure your dependent variable is in the right order\ndf$interest = factor(df$interest, c('Not', 'Somewhat', 'Very'))\n\nNote: These data have been inspired by farmer survey data sets, but have simulated values and therefore do not reflect any actual farmers.\n\npolr\nMost ordered logit models, such as those run with the defaults of the polr function, assume a cumulative link function. A cumulative link function looks at the probability of being at one level, compared to all of the levels below them (e.g. P(Y&gt;=2)). This is the only kind of link function available in polr, which is important to keep in mind when later comparing it to vglm.\nNow, let’s take a look at our model, where we are interested in seeing how farm operator/operation variables, attitudes, and information affect a farmer’s interest in a technology.\n\npolr.model &lt;- polr(interest ~ acres + income + education + econ.value + \n                     envt.value + info.count, data = df, Hess = T) \n# We use Hess = T in order to return the Hessian matrix, which allows us to look at the model's summary\nsummary(polr.model)\n\nCall:\npolr(formula = interest ~ acres + income + education + econ.value + \n    envt.value + info.count, data = df, Hess = T)\n\nCoefficients:\n              Value Std.

These results indicate that economic attitudes and income are significantly negatively correlated with technology interest, and environmental attitudes and information sources is positively correlated.

What is assumed here is that the slopes from level to level of the dependent variable are relatively similar, allowing us to use only one coefficient per independent variable. The Brant test was developed to test this assumption, and the brant package and function allow us to quickly test this with polr model objects.\n\nbrant(polr.model)\n\n-------------------------------------------- \nTest for    X2  df  probability \n-------------------------------------------- \nOmnibus     33.3    6   0\nacres       0.43    1   0.51\nincome      0.35    1   0.55\neducation   1.47    1   0.22\necon.value  19.17   1   0\nenvt.value  1   1   0.32\ninfo.count  1.46    1   0.23\n-------------------------------------------- \n\nH0: Parallel Regression Assumption holds\n\n\nThis test evaluates whether or not the proportional odds assumption has been met, where the null hypothesis is that the assumption has been met. In this case, a p-value &lt; 0.05 is cause to reject the null hypothesis, meaning that reject the proportional odds assumption. Based on these outputs, we see that the overall (Omnibus) model fails the proportional odds test, where probability = 0, and this is particularly driven by economic values, where the p-value is \\(1.2^{-5}\\).\nA failed proportional odds assumption calls for a non-proportional ordered logit, or at least partial proportional model. However, polr doesn’t allow us to do this, which is where we switch to vglm.\n\n\nvglm\nThe vglm function can model more advanced ordinal regressions – non-proportional and partial proportional, as well as different link functions. However, it requires a few more model specifications than the polr model. We will explore these using the same data as above.\nFirst, you need to specify the family of the link function. As noted above, the default family for polr and most people thinking about ordered logits is the cumulative link function, so for now we will leave it at that with family = cumulative. (See my post on the sequential ordered logit using the cratio link function). We also get to specify whether or not the parallel odds assumption, also called the proportional odds assumption, has been met with parallel = T/F. Last, the default in vglm is to reverse the order of the ordered dependent variable, so most intuitive interpretations require that the order be reversed with reverse = T. Below are examples of running the proportional, non-proportional, and partial proportional models. Note that the partial proportional model is specified by using a ~ followed by the variable(s) that you want to be left not proportional.\n\n# a proportional model\nvgam.model.prop &lt;- vglm(ordered(interest) ~ acres + income + education + \n                         econ.value + envt.value + info.count, data = df, \n                       family=cumulative(parallel = T, reverse = T))\n\n# a non-proportional model\nvgam.model.nonprop &lt;- vglm(ordered(interest) ~ acres + income + education + \n                            econ.value + envt.value + info.count,  data = df, \n                          family=cumulative(parallel = F, reverse = T))\n\n# a partial proportional model\nvgam.model.partialprop &lt;- vglm(ordered(interest) ~ acres + income + education + \n                                econ.value + envt.value + info.count, data = df, \n                              family=cumulative(parallel = F ~ econ.value, reverse = T))\n\nWhile polr model objects of the S3 class, as are most objects in R, vglm models are S4. In this case, while some functions operate the same, others vary. For instance, you can use the same summary() function.\n\n# vagm models provide p-values immediately\nsummary(vgam.model.partialprop)\n\n\nCall:\nvglm(formula = ordered(interest) ~ acres + income + education + \n    econ.value + envt.value + info.count, family = cumulative(parallel = F ~ \n    econ.value, reverse = T), data = df)\n\nCoefficients: \n              Estimate Std.

So, I wanted to continue the legacy by keeping the template alive and well (you should too, by following the guide to contributing updates as necessary during use!).\nBeyond using the template, I wanted to make my dissertation-writing life as easy as possible by integrating my mode of writing (Google Docs) with the aggiedown template. As it stands, Peek proposes either writing chapters directly into the chapter Rmd files in the package, or knitting from a “child” Rmd that lives inside a specific project. While both of these options are great, working in Google Docs until the very end let me work in edits from my committee up until the last minute, and allowed me to work with my reference manager of choice (Zotero plug-in to Google Docs) instead of dealing much with BibTeX.\nSo, I created a workflow for converting a Google Doc with Zotero-embedded references into an Rmd document that will play nicely with LaTeX templates. Though I designed this for aggiedown, it is likely tweak-able for other LaTeX templates as well. This tutorial outlines what to do, however, it assumes you have read the aggiedown README file for an understanding of how that package works first."

    "text": "Doing your thing in Google Docs\nSo, you’re writing your dissertation in a Google Doc. Great. You should use docs as you wish, with only a few things to pay attention to.\n\nUse headers appropriately. Google Docs (like Word) has text related settings where you can set Titles, Header 1, Header 2, etc. These translated well to Markdown, and so we need to make sure we use these in a consistent and compatible way with the dissertation format. Your Chapter Title should be Header 1, and then all main sections (e.g. Introduction, Methods, etc.) should be Header 2. You can continue down to subsections as much as you wish. For references, please make a Header 1 titled ‘References’ at the end of the document.\nChapter marks. To get friendly chapter marks, as advised by Ryan Peek in the aggiedown guidelines, you can embed this right into the doc (e.g. [backslash]chaptermark {organic seed policy}. Also note that because this is Chapter 1, I have a set-up chunk with the packages I need to read in images and load tables. More on chunks in the next point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode chunks. So, you’ll need to manually insert chunks, which is a trickier part. You can surely paste in your figures and tables and stuff as you write. But towards the end you’ll want to work with the model of inserting chunks into the text instead of the inserting figures and tables. For example, here I am loading in a figure, which is easy to you only need to set your chunk options and load the right path.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTables are a little trickier. All of my tables are saved as .csv files in my projects, and I have to read them in and do some manual changes to get them right. This means sometimes renaming column names and setting some kable and kableExtra options to get my table just right. Important: be sure to include a colon (;) after each line of code so that eventually the rendering will recognize a line break in the code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZotero settings. You can write the dissertation with any citation format you want via Zotero (MLA, APSA, etc.), but when you’re in the end/knitting phase, you’ll want to switchto BibTex format. See above for the directions for downloading and switching the Settings for the Style Manager. Note, in text this options is very ugly, but the heart of the conversion function is making it into something usable, so deal with it.\nReferences. I said it in 1., but it bears repeating. Insert your bibliography under a Header 1 sections called “References”. The spelling a capitalization matters here, so please be conscious of that.\nMisc formatting. This conversion will recognize simple markup like bolding and italics, will ignore things like comments in the document, but it will panic a little but over highlighting. Please don’t use highlight markup. To embed links, you can use standard markdown link embedding. For citing page numbers, I have not figured out how to put this into the workflow, so I just do not link these inline citations to Zotero."

In each chapter .Rmd built in to the aggiedown package (e.g. 01-chap1.Rmd), you’ll want to set them up so that they knit from the Rmds created in the previous step. In each chapter Rmd, you can mimic the following code chunk to draw it in. This is the only thing you need in each chapter Rmd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal touches. At the very end (i.e. you’re not going to run prep_papers.R any more) you can make any specific manual edits that you’d like by directly editing the chapter’s Rmd in the chapter project. For example, one of the main bugs that I hadn’t solved relates to footnotes. They overwrite one another because they do not get continuously numbered. If you have footnotes, you’ll need to run each chapter Rmd and make the numbers continous, otherwise you’ll have issues.\n\nOnce you’ve followed these steps, you should be able to knit from the index.Rmd file in the aggiedown package and render your thesis, stored as thesis.pdf in the book/ directory of the project.\nA few pages are below as an example. On page v., the rendering takes all of the first and second headers from the Google Doc into the table of contents. On page 5, you see the chapter title, introduction header, and then that references are embedded and linked to the bibliography, formatted based on how I specified the csl. Then on pages 16 and 19, the figure and table I showed as chunks in text are fitting in the final rendering. Note also that the page header alternatives between chapter mark on even pages (e.g. CHAPTER 1. ORGANIC SEED POLICY) and subsection headers on odd pages (e.g. 3. METHODS)."

My research fills this gap by analyzing niche innovation systems using social network methods, focusing on an innovation that is deeply intertwined with regional agro-ecological diversity: agricultural seeds. Specifically, I work with the case of the organic seed niche – a network of informational, economic, and ecological relationships – built using original survey data of organic seed stakeholders in the US.

    "text": "UC graduate students have been striking for three days now, and graduate students and faculty alike still have questions about the Union’s demands. Particularly, there are a number of running comments I hear that challenge the strikers demands. I’d like to create some posts responding to these throughout the strike weeks.\nOne of the comments I’ve heard is: Graduate students are asking to be paid more than some faculty. And well, are they? Having a base understanding of faculty pay is critical to understanding that question. The good news is that public salaries over a certain threshold are publicly released, and so we can easily contextualize graduate student pay demands alongside faculty pay.\nAn initial look at the University of California Faculty Pay Ladder might suggest that yes, asking for $54,000 for 50% FTE ($108,000 100% FTE) is more than what these faculty steps outline. But I think it is important to look a bit deeper, both at faculty pay and at the demands of the union. This blog will do just that to make two key points:\n1. UCOP Faculty pay ladder alone is misleading\n2. Graduate students have so much to gain from bargaining for even a fraction of the union’s current demands"

    "text": "How much do UC faculty make?\nThe University of California Faculty Pay Ladder for General faculty and a higher tier of faculty from Business, Economics, and Engineering have been used by faculty to signal to students: Look, faculty don’t make all that much more than graduate students, especially not compared to their $54,000 demand. But publicly available data about faculty salaries suggest otherwise.\nI have scraped publicly available salaries through the Transparent California database for faculty in the University of California system. I’ve focused on Assistant, Associate, and Full faculty, both AY and FY, within typical university departments (i.e. I have removed Medical and Law school faculty) in 2021. The total number of faculty represented is 7867. (Note that there are some faculty excluded from these data given rate limits on the Transparent California page, but I have done my best to ensure that the variation is random. See the uc-faculty-pay script for details on the data scraping).\nWhen comparing the UC pay ladder to both “regular pay”, as termed in the Transparent California database, as well as “other pay,” (off-scale), it is clear that the hiring process looks quite different in practice than on paper. Below I visualize the ranges of pay according to the UCOP scale, regular pay, and regular + other pay. Note that I have limited the y-axis so to more clearly see the difference in median values across the categories, but this hides the upper end salaries of Full professors, which at a maximum is $778,102.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also take a look at a table of the average salaries across these categories, below.\n\n\n\nAverage pay according to faculty rank across all UC faculty\n\n\nRank\nUCOP scale\nRegular pay\nTotal pay\n\n\n\n\nAssistant\n$ 88,110\n$ 112,762\n$ 138,316\n\n\nAssociate\n$ 104,444\n$ 128,664\n$ 152,256\n\n\nFull\n$ 145,317\n$ 204,647\n$ 244,142\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we take a look at these numbers, it seems like the UCOP pay scale is only representing somewhere between 60-65% of what faculty are actually making across the UC.\nNow, these are data all across the UC, spanning wide reaches of departments, expertise, etc., so we might say that these numbers are a bit exaggerated. To be sure this check wasn’t missing some faculty grouping that over-inflated the numbers, I spot checked the data by scraping only the faculty in my department: Environmental Science and Policy at UC Davis, in 2021. Among these 20 faculty, average salaries across ranks tend to be about $20,000 less than across the whole UC system, but this is likely because Davis offers different salaries than the rest of the state, and ESP is not among the highest ranking salary ladders (for instance, the Business, Economics, and Engineering departments are simply hired at higher rates, even on paper). So it seems like these UC numbers, both state-wide and hyper-locally, can give us a decent picture of UC faculty salary ranges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage pay for UCD ESP faculty\n\n\nRank\nUCOP scale\nRegular pay\nTotal pay\n\n\n\n\nAssistant\n$ 88,110\n$ 99,525\n$ 109,572\n\n\nAssociate\n$ 104,444\n$ 126,977\n$ 152,874\n\n\nFull\n$ 145,317\n$ 201,382\n$ 220,094\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s think about these numbers. Even in a world where the union gets its demands of $54,000 for 50% FTE, this will still never realistically be higher than faculty. Even if a graduate student were working at their absolute maximum, 75% during the academic year and 100% during the summer at the demanded rate, they would make $87,750. For context, the lowest total salary in the Environmental Science and Policy Department is $96,619. But also importantly, there is absolutely no world in which the union gets their maximum ask. So let’s consider what graduate students realistically stand to gain during this bargaining process."

    "text": "What kinds of salary might graduate students realistically gain from the strike?\nI’ll admit, I myself have balked at the $54,000 demand by the union. I’ve already addressed this elsewhere, so I’ll point to a piece I wrote the other week regarding the reality of graduate student pay, and how the bargaining process might actually land us somewhere competitive. In summary, I know $54,000 is not realistic. But a realistic ask (between $36,837 and $42,573, depending on whether or not we adjust for different costs of living across campus) would make a huge difference for graduate students, and keep graduate student pay competitive with its peers. This pay raise, from $29,621 to $36,837, about a 30% raise, also puts UC graduate students in similar relative positions to faculty in their departments.\nTo understand graduate student pay relative to faculty pay, let’s look at the average pay across faculty ranks for Environmental Science and Policy Department at UC Davis (regular pay, not including additional ‘other’ pay), compared to pay from another large public university’s environmental science department: University of Michigan’s School for Environment and Sustainability. Pays are relatively similar for faculty between the two schools, with slightly higher rates at UCD. But when we overlay graduate student data here, we see that graduate students at Michigan make nearly $7,000 more annually than UCD graduate students at 50% FTE. What this means is that graduate students at UCD make relatively less money than peers in Michigan, not just in absolute terms but also relative to the faculty. For example relative to Associate Professors, graduate students in Michigan make 31% of their salary while those in California make 23% of their salary.\nA realistic bargain, then, as outlined in my previous post, is 90% of living wage in the area. This would boost UCD graduate students’ salaries up on par with Michigan and still only less than a third of what faculty make, at 50% FTE (see table below). And even if students work at their maximum (75% FTE all academic year and 100% FTE all summer), they would earn $59,860 – still only 60% of the mean Assistant Professor salary, before ‘other pay’.\n\n\n\nAverage faculty pay and its relationship to graduate student pay\n\n\nRank\nUniversity of Michigan\nUniversity of California (current)\nUniversity of California (realistic bargain)\n\n\n\n\nGraduate Student\n$ 36,082\n$ 29,621\n$ 36,837\n\n\nAssistant\n103453 (35%)\n99525 (30%)\n99525 (37%)\n\n\nAssociate\n118012 (31%)\n126977 (23%)\n126977 (29%)\n\n\nFull\n187309 (19%)\n201382 (15%)\n201382 (18%)"

The strike is driven by many years running of incremental bargaining for improved cost of living and rights for all types of student-related UC employment, from junior specialists and GSRs, to TAs and post-docs. The main point of the strike that interests me is the proposed cost of living adjustments. I can attest to the general sentiment that graduate students feel over-worked, underpaid, and constantly battling administrative and bureaucratic hurdles to ensure their employment every 12 weeks. But at the same time, the UC bargaining team has proposed a pretty radical number for fair wages for all ‘Grad Workers’ (unspecified in who exactly they mean here): $54,000 as a minimum salary, assuming that graduate students are working 50% year-round.\nThe Union’s proposal of $54,000 for 50% full-time equivalent (FTE) sounds radically high, and it is. My gut response to this number was rejection – it felt unjustifiable. But before denying it outright, I wanted to understand more about how high this really is relative to current UCD student salaries, and how this compares to other graduate student salaries across the country. This short opinion pieces summarizes what I’ve learned.\nNote: This consideration of pay considers ‘Grad Workers’ as Teaching Assistants and Graduate Student Researchers. While Fellows are a part of the newly formed SRU and are currently bargaining alongside the GSRs and TAs, I have already seen language in the UC’s proposals to define Grad Workers as those ‘paid through UC Path’, which I think excludes Fellows."

    "text": "How much money do UC graduate students make?\nFirst things first: What is the pay baseline we’re starting from? The UAW website says that the ‘most common’ salary for graduate students is $23,247, citing UCDP. I assume this is UC Data Portal, but it is not clear how to access this, when the data is from, and how that was calculated. So instead I took data from the UCD Grad Studies Pay Scale document that comes out annually (this one is old because, well, still bargaining). Here we have a flat TA rate of $46,493, which is a 9-month rate at 100%, calculating out to $2,582.95 each month TAing at 50%. There are also GSR rates, which has default steps for a compensation plan, whereby Step III is (usually) the initial appointment. I will consider this the GSR minimum, based on my understanding of the system, though this decision may make graduate student minimum pay appear slightly higher. The Step III GSR rate is $52,604 at a 12-month rate, calculating out to $2,191.84 each month GSRing at 50%. My general understanding is that these pay rates are standardized across the UC campuses. A quick look at the pay scales for UC Santa Barbara and UCLA seem to confirm this.\nUsing these data, I define the minumum graduate student income to be some mix of these two employment methods, where a student’s annual salary working year-round at 50% with a 50/50 mix of these appointments is $28,648.62. This is a pretty big departure from UAW’s estimate, especially considering this is my minimum compared to what sounds like their idea of average (my calculated average is $29,621). That aside, we’ll proceed with my estimated minimum because it followed a standardized approach (50% mixed appointments), which I use for understanding other university pay rates.\n\n\n\n\nA generous calculation of a graduate student’s salary working 50% FTE year-round is, at minimum, $28,648.62, and as an average, $29,621"

    "text": "How does UC pay compare to other graduate programs?\nIt is important to know your worth on the market. Graduate students generally know that pay is low, but how low is too low? What is a competitive asking price? One way to answer this question is compare UC salaries to other graduate pay rates across the country.\nI selected a handful of other universities that feel comparable to where I am housed (UC Davis), and that have some overlap with my work in environmental policy. They feel comparable in that they are large public universities from various locations across the country, capturing a range of living costs. And as a member of the Environmental Science and Policy Department, I wanted to know how graduate students are paid in schools that have comparable Environmental Science/Environmental Policy programs. I settled on the following universities, with their details below:\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity\nUndergrad #\nPostgrad #\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of California, Davis\n31,162\n8,869\n\n\nUniversity of Washington\n32,779\n16,246\n\n\nUniversity of Florida\n37,874\n15,916\n\n\nUniversity of Michigan, Ann Arbor\n31,329\n16,578\n\n\nUniversity of Georgia\n40,118\n9,952\n\n\nIndiana University, Bloomington\n34,253\n11,075\n\n\nArizona State University\n38,528\n10,943\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI grabbed the pay rates for graduate students from each of these schools. The details of where I found and collated these data can be found annotated in my grad-pay-rate script. From my look across these documents, other universities tend to set a clear minimum for graduate pay, but less detail on the various employment categories. Because this is the case, I’ll stick with using the minimum pay for these graduate programs when comparing pay scales.\nLet’s first see how UC grad student pay measures up in absolute terms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, in absolute terms, UC is somewhere in the middle of the pack according to minimum pay rates. But these are in absolute terms. How does this pay relate to the financial demands of the location? This is what I explore next."

    "text": "How does UC pay compare to other program given the cost of living in each city?\nHow to measure cost of living in a city is not easy. UAW seems to be relying on union member surveys to gather data on how much rent costs are for graduate students, which they use as the basis to discuss rent burden. I’m not entirely convinced by their approach here, but luckily, there are tools that can provide some rich data on cost-of living. I rely on the MIT’s Living Wage Calculator, which I think provides a well-documented understanding of living wages (thank you Tara Pozzi, for suggesting this resource).\n\n\n\n\nUniversity\nCity\nMIT Living Wage\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Michigan, Ann Arbor\nAnn Arbor, MI\n$ 38,537\n\n\nArizona State University\nTempe, AZ\n$ 36,504\n\n\nIndiana University, Bloomington\nBloomington, IN\n$ 33,065\n\n\nUniversity of Florida\nGainseville, FL\n$ 31,748\n\n\nUniversity of Washington\nSeattle, WA\n$ 41,198\n\n\nUniversity of California, Davis\nDavis, CA\n$ 40,930\n\n\nUniversity of Georgia\nAthens, GA\n$ 33,042\n\n\nUniversity of California, Santa Barbara\nSanta Barbara, CA\n$ 50,497\n\n\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles\nLos Angeles, CA\n$ 44,961\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that these calculated estimates should be taken with a grain of salt. For example, MIT estimates that housing costs under ‘living wages’ are $1,174/month in Davis, while UAW estimates somewhere between $1,131-$1,643. MIT’s estimate is based on Yolo County, and for areas like Los Angeles, the estimate is based on the whole of the metropolitan area. So of course, it should be recognized that areas close to universities campuses are perhaps more expensive than the ‘greater area’ represented by these MIT calculator numbers.\nWith that caveat, let’s take a look at what the minimum graduate student pay is, as a proportion of the area’s living wage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce adjusting for the cost of living, UC compares poorly to its peers. The average proportion of the living wage covered by 50% employment (at the minimum rate) by the six other schools in these data is .82. UC Davis, one of the cheapest UC campuses, is 12% lower than the mean proportion of these living schools, coming in at .7 of the area’s living wage. Pricier UC campuses fare even worse, with graduate students at UCLA making .64 and UCSB making .57 of the living wage. From this preliminary look, it is pretty clear:\n\n\n\n\nUC pay for graduate students lags behind comparable programs across the country and needs to take considerable action to step up."

    "text": "How do Union demands map onto national grad pay norms?\nThe UC’s current proposal – which has been rejected by the Union – is for a 7% salary increase in year one. This kind of raise would bring the minimum from $28,622 to $30,625.54. For the Davis, LA, and Santa Barbara campuses respectively, this would still leave grad students at .75, .68, and .61 of the living wage. This still leaves UC campuses far below average compared to its peers.\nInstead, UAW’s proposal sets an ambitious new minimum of $54,000 at 50% FTE. Compared to the current minimum pay, this is a 88.6% rate of increase, 1.32 times the living wage in Davis. Compared to other universities, it looks like a big ask:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe union’s proposal is high, and perhaps overshoots a justifiable mark. But so what would a more realistic ask be? Based on data from comparable universities, it seems like 90% of a city’s living wage is a competitive ask. Because the UC wants to set UC-wide pay grades, let’s take a look at the living wages across 9 UC campuses (SF excluded):\n\n\n\n\n\nUC Campus\nLiving wage\n\n\n\n\nBerkeley\n$ 53,149\n\n\nSanta Barbara\n$ 52,675\n\n\nLos Angeles\n$ 45,536\n\n\nSan Diego\n$ 47,304\n\n\nRiverside\n$ 38,821\n\n\nMerced\n$ 34,219\n\n\nIrvine\n$ 51,843\n\n\nSanta Cruz\n$ 54,571\n\n\nDavis\n$ 40,930\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe values from across MIT’s Living Wage Calculator estimates that the median cost of living across the 9 campuses is $47,304, and 90% of that is $42,573. Let’s take a look at how this proposal adjusts UC’s place among its peers for graduate student pay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this more reasonable, UC-wide proposal, UC Davis is very comfortably at the top, making right around a living wage for the area. But campuses like Santa Barbara (and also even more expensive campuses like Berkeley and Santa Cruz), are still very average in terms of pay as a proportion of a living wage. Personally, I think the differences between cost of living are so considerable that it would be fair to be negotiating for 90% of living wage adjusting for the campus. If this were there case, Davis’s campus would still be competitive by offering a minimum wage of $36,837."

    "text": "Re-analysis in the context of barganing\nHere’s my take: UC proposes as 7% raise, UAW is asking for an 88% raise, and my data is pointing to a more realistic/competitive ask of 45% raise. And well, if bargaining works where folks end up meeting in the middle, then we’d land right about at the 40% raise mark, which feels like a competitive win. So my impression is that the strike should not be about getting to $54,000, but rather, starting high in response to UC starting very, very low, and using that to land on a reasonable middle ground where the UC system can be competitive among its peers. I encourage folks not balk at $54,000, rather to think critically about how this demand can help us enter the bargaining room with plenty of room for compromise and discussion about fair wages.\n\n\n\ntl;dr I will strike to increase bargaining power in the hopes that we can agree to a reasonable middle-ground, making the UC a system with competitive university pay. If we agree to a fixed value across the UC, students other UC campuses would benefit very meaningfully and Davis students would outmatch its competitors."

    "section": "Claim 1: Competitive compensation",
    "text": "Claim 1: Competitive compensation\nProvost Brown’s letter states: “Under our current proposals, our academic student employees would be among the highest compensated among public universities in the Association of American Universities (AAU), with compensation similar to what top private institutions offer.”\nThere was a similar quote in an article in the SF Chronicle: “In its statement, the university defended its offers to the union, saying that if accepted, the wages would be among the best paid in public universities and ‘more comparable to private universities such as Harvard, MIT, and USC.’”.\nThese comparisons claiming competitive compensation are unsubstantiated. In a comparison to other public universities around the country, University of California lags behind, and the proposed increases of 7-10% would still leave us at the tail end. I’ve already explored UC pay relative to other schools in another post, but here is a quick visualization of where UC would fall, relative to cost of living, compared to other public universities under the UC’s proposal. A 7% raise brings grad students on UC campuses up from the current 57-70% of their area’s living wage to 61-75% of living wage. This pales in comparison to its public university peers, who pay an average of 82% living wage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, claiming that this puts UC on par with ‘top private institutions’ has no basis. A UC graduate student employed at 50% at a Step III appointment (which is considered the default minimum hiring rate, according to UCD salary scales, see the next point for further discussion), is $2,191. A 10% increase (again, being generous, see the next section) would be $2,410.\nIn contrast, Harvard’s compensation plan, which is the base rate for all students regardless of employment is $3,549 per month. Stanford’s compensation plan for 50% FTE is a minimum of $3,816 per month. The UC’s proposal positions its graduates students to making less than 70% of the top private institutions the administration claims to match."

    "text": "Claim 2: 9-10% increase for GSRs\nProvost Brown’s letter states: “Most GSRs will see 9-10 percent increases in year one of the contract, with a 3 percent increase in each subsequent year. GSRs who are on the lowest two salary points will see a 17-26 percent increase in the first year. For example, a GSR who is currently on Step 2 with a 50% appointment will see their monthly salary increase by 17.5 percent in the first year of the contract.”\nThis claim is misleading for those unfamiliar with how hiring across steps works in practice. The focus of this claim is put on the 17-26% raise for Step I and II GSRs, but there’s an issue here. At least according to the UC Davis’s account of the Graduate Student Salary Scale, the default compensation plan is such that Step III is the “initial appointment of student with a bachelor’s degree only.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to this default plan then, Step I and Step II shouldn’t be used. I cannot speak to how many students are actually hired at these steps, but personally and among my peers, the initial hiring is Step III. Step III is also what I have considered the ‘minimum’ in my analyses so far. What this means is that the UC’s most impressive-looking talking point is moot. They’re proposing wage increases for steps on a salary scale that, by the own proposed default, shouldn’t be used.\nAs a result, it calls into question the more general claim of a 9-10% increase for GSRs. If the increases are 17% and 26% for Steps I and II, these values could be over inflating the increase gained by other steps. UC is not explicit about this. On their webpage they state that: Current rates are $22,005 — $43,119 and proposed rates are $28,275 — $47,679. SO we can then assume that highest step, Step X, increases by 11%. But again, the UC default scale suggests that student post-QE should be hired at Steps VI-VII, meaning that Steps IX and X are very atypical. From my personal experience, as a fifth year student with well-developed data analysis skills, I have negotiated for only one Step IX appointment under the employment of a very supportive faculty member. So if 17%, 26% and 11% are the increases for steps that are generally not relevant to graduate students, the remaining increases in Steps III-IX must be lower to generate a 9-10% average increase. Most likely then, the raises for the most relevant steps are only about 5%. I would appreciate seeing a step by step breakdown of the raise increases to better understand what’s being offered to the most relevant salary steps."

    "section": "Simulate networks, ERGM",
    "text": "Simulate networks, ERGM\nNow that we understand simulate_baseline, we can use a more complex baseline model. Rather than use a random graph, which most graphs are likely to be significantly different from, we can simulate networks using Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs).\nFor SENs, however, we need to think about what kind of ERGM makes sense as baseline. Sometimes, ecological networks are ‘fixed’, meaning that ecological relationships are not a matter of choice. In an example, the interdependence between hydrological areas are fairly fixed (barring engineering) because water flows are dependent on the geomorphology of a place. In these scenarios, we can estimate a ‘partial’ ERGM, using only the social level, given that this is the only level really able to change.\nTo do this, we make a subgraph of our SEN to include just the social actors, and specify an ERGM.\n\n## So we can create a subgraph of just the social level\nactor_net &lt;- motifr::induced_level_subgraph(SEN_net, \n                                            level = 1, \n                                            lvl_attr = \"sesType\")\n### And then specify an ergm for the actors\nactor_ergm &lt;- ergm(actor_net ~ density + \n                     nodematch(\"type\", diff=TRUE) +\n                     nodefactor(\"type\") + \n                     gwdegree(.5, fixed = TRUE) +\n                     gwesp(.25, fixed=TRUE))\n\nThen we use this partial ERGM as the baseline model for our simulations.\n\n## Now, instead of model = erdos renyi, model = 'partial-ergm', \n## specify what level the ergm is partial for, and the ergm itself\nsim_ergm_p &lt;- simulate_baseline(SEN_net,\n                                motifs_of_interest, \n                                n = n_iter, \n                                lvl_attr = \"sesType\",\n                                model = \"partial_ergm\",\n                                level = 1,\n                                ergm_model = actor_ergm\n                                )\n\nIn a case where ecological nodes are not fixed (e.g. foraging behavior), we can also run and set a full ERGM as your baseline.\n\nse_ergm &lt;- ergm(SEN_net ~ edges + \n                          nodefactor(\"sesType\") +\n                          gwdegree(.5, fixed = TRUE) +\n                          gwesp(.25, fixed=TRUE))\n\n\nsim_ergm &lt;- simulate_baseline(SEN_net,\n                                motifs_of_interest, \n                                n = n_iter, \n                                lvl_attr = \"sesType\",\n                                model = \"ergm\",\n                                ergm_model = se_ergm\n                                )"

    "text": "I have six years of undergraduate and graduate teaching experience across disciplines, levearging different pedagogical approaches. I specialize in data science and environmental studies courses.\n\nCourses\n\nData science\nI am passionate about teaching coding and data analysis across disciplines, and have several years’ experience leading methods courses. For example:\n\nR Data Analysis for Visualization in Science: I co-instructed this course for one term (10 weeks) every year between 2020-2022, teaching R programming to over 100 PhD and Master’s students. This course takes students who have no prior experience with programming to an intermediate level of familiarity with R, giving them the skills necessary to manage projects and clean, reshape and visualize data, all to support their independent research projects in environmental and social sciences. (UC Davis, ECL 298)\nAdventures in Data Science: I worked as a Teaching Assistant for this course, working closely with the Directors of the DataLab to develop and deliver course material to undergraduate students across disciplines. This was a two-part course, where in the first term we trained students from across social sciences and humanities in the basics of programming in bash, git/GitHub, and R. In the second term, students engaged in experiential learning by working in small groups on real-world data projects proposed by faculty across campus. (UC Davis, IST 8x)\nR for Water Resources Data Science: I work with the Convole Cooperative to run Introductory and Intermediate R workshops for professionals working at the California State Water Board.\n\nBeyond formal teaching, I am passionate about fostering inclusive coding communities. For two years (2021-2023), I co-coordinated the Davis R Users Group (D-RUG), a weekly working group of graduate students and university staff addressing computational and statistical challenges in R. Through this role and others, I have been invited to lead several workshops on various coding topics, many of which are available on my workshops page.\n\n\nSustainability studies\nI have designed and taught two interdisciplinary courses on food and agriculture, integrating experiential learning through community service and study abroad.\n\nFarm to Fork: The Sustainable Food Movement in Charleston: Lectures covered the cultural, political, and environmental challenges and solutions facing food systems in the US, with a focus on local issues. Beyond lectures, students were required 10 hours of community-based learning, during which students engaged in activities along the food chain, from volunteering in local gardens to preparing and distributing food at food banks (CofC, FYSE 148).\n\nSustainable Food in the Foothills of the Andes: This course was built around a study abroad experience, where I led students on a 10-day trip to Peru to engage with communities in the cross hairs of sustainable development dilemmas. We engaged with organizations like CGIAR’s international potato gene bank in Lima and the Compadre coffee cooperative in the central jungle, which allowed students to connect their food systems curriculum to real-world experiences (CofC, FYET 177).\n\n\n\nGeneral education\nI have experience as Teaching Assistant (leading discussions and marking) for several introduction and general education courses.\n\nOrganic Crop Production Practicum (UC Davis, PLS 49)\n\nCurrent Issues in the Environment (UC Davis, ESP 10)\n\nIntroduction to American Studies (UC Davis, AMS 10)\n\n\n\n\n\nPedagogy\nI aim to be pedagogically creative, using experiential learning techniques and problem-based learning to create engaged classroom environments.\nExperiential learning – where students engage in real-world projects beyond the classroom setting – has been a corner stone of my pedagogical approach. For example in my in my sustainability courses, I worked closely with the College’s Center for Civic Engagement to incorporate community-based learning into the curriculum. And in data science courses, my work with the UC Davis DataLab connected students with research projects solicited from faculty across campus.\nIn cases where it isn’t reasonable to incorporate experiential learning into course design, I use other engagement techniques. For instance, I use problem-based methods where small groups work through pointed discussion questions or technical challenges to help them connect to the content and to one another.\nTheses approaches were developed and honed during my time as the Assistant Director of First-Year Experience (FYE) at College of Charleston (2016-2018), an academic program dedicated to pedagogy and mentorship for supporting undergraduates transitioning into higher education. In this role I also worked with faculty across departments to study student transitions into higher education, with the accompanying publication below.\nChaffin, L., C. A. Korey, C. Warnick, and L. Wood (2019). Life So Far: A Grounded Theory Analysis of College Student Transitions Through the Sophomore Year. Journal of The First-Year Experience & Students in Transition 31: 79–93."
