    "text": "I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Exeter. I work with the EU Horizon/UKRI InBestSoil project, focusing on collaborative organizational strategies and business models for soil health. I earned my PhD at University of California Davis in the Environmental Policy specialization of the Ecology Graduate Group, with a designated emphasis in Computational Social Science. My research spans four areas: science in policymaking, innovation systems and networks, agri-environmental regulation, and innovation for the public good. I specialize in cases related to agri-food systems, ranging from agrobiodiversity management and organic certification to nitrogen policy. I also hold degrees in Sustainability Science and Policy (MSc), Organic Farming (MSc), and Biology and Political Science (BA).\nThis website includes workshops and tutorials in R that focus on computational and statistical topics. I am enthusiastic about teaching and publicly sharing code to promote data and statistical literacy, particularly for early learners."
