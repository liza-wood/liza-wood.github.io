I work with the EU Horizon/UKRI InBestSoil project, focusing on collaborative organizational strategies and business models for soil health. I earned my PhD at University of California Davis in the Environmental Policy specialization of the Ecology Graduate Group, with a designated emphasis in Computational Social Science. My research spans four areas: science in policymaking, innovation systems and networks, agri-environmental regulation, and innovation for the public good. I specialize in cases related to agri-food systems, ranging from agrobiodiversity management and organic certification to nitrogen policy. I also hold degrees in Sustainability Science and Policy (MSc), Organic Farming (MSc), and Biology and Political Science (BA).\nThis website includes workshops and tutorials in R that focus on computational and statistical topics. I am enthusiastic about teaching and publicly sharing code to promote data and statistical literacy, particularly for early learners."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Talk about Artificial Intelligence is everywhere. From university teaching, student essays, academic research, regulatory consultations, and even a whole array of unnecessary appliances like toothbrushes.\nThis post is about AI, and more specifically, Machine Learning (ML) in research. To be self-referential, claude.ai generated this overview of different ML methods and how they relate. ML covers a wide array of approaches for computer prediction based on ‘learning’ (i.e. giving the computer data). Learning is usually classified into three types: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement.\n\n\n\nOverview of machine learning concepts, generated by claude.ai\n\n\nIn each of these categories, the figure highlights that various statistical methods that have been around for quite a while fall under the ML umbrella, such as statistical regression (supervised) and Principle Component Analysis (unsupervised). But beyond these traditional approaches, each of these types of learning can use ‘neural networks’ for deep learning.\nNeural networks – computational models inspired by neural networks in biology – are typically ‘trained’ (supervised) on data so that it learns how to minimize the difference in the output and the values in the training dataset. One popular software for implementing neural networks is (Keras.io)[https://keras.io/], allowing researchers to train and develop their own predictive models.\nThe ‘transformer’ architecture behind models like ChatGPT and Claude has evolved from these sorts of neural networks (but critically, rely on a ‘self-attention mechanism’ to predict word sequence). And after being trained on massive amounts of text1, the resulting Large Language Models (LLMs) are what we can chat with in either an unsupervised fashion (open chats) or supervised fashion (LLMs that are tuned to specific tasks).\n\n\nNow that LLMs have already been trained on huge amounts of data, researchers are able to leverage the learning that has already been done to help assist with research tasks. Researchers are using LLMs in a variety of ways, ranging from synthesizing social data to generating research ideas.\nThis post is specifically about text classification (and sometimes interpretation) – reading a text and grouping the text according to a decision criteria, or extracting some feature of the text."
